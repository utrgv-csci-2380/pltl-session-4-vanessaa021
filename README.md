# PLTL Session

Use this repo to work on your PLTL problems, this way you can save your work and share it with your Leaders or professor to get extra help or extra credit (if it was previously mentioned).

# Compiling/Running

You should be using Codespaces to work on the PLTL sessions. You can compile on the terminal with ```g++ pltl.cpp``` and run with ```./a.out```
More complex compilations will required the first command to include all cpp files you are using for the program, but a Makefile will be provided if the compilation needs any special options.
